<ul>
  <li>Apparently calling a signal's getter() from within a template isn't a bad thing. Probably because of the caching?</li>
  <li>Simpler and more efficient than Observables for state changes.</li>
  <li>If used in services, the services will need to be public, or pass-through signals will be needed.</li>
</ul>
